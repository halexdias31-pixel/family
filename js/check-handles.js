   @family. — check-handles.js

   A USERNAME IS THE ONE THING A PERSON TYPES THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO LOOK AT.

   Every other check here measures whether the app WORKS. This one and `check-marking.js` are the two
   that measure whether it is SAFE to hand to a child, and the failures are not symmetrical:

     a rude handle let through   is on a tutoring site, beside children's names, until somebody sees
                                 it — and the person who sees it first is a parent
     a real name refused         is somebody who has done nothing, told no, with no way to argue

   The second is why `HANDLE_ALLOWED` exists at all, and why half the cases below are words that
   must be let through rather than words that must not.

   ---------- AND THE RULE THAT IS NOT ABOUT WORDS AT ALL ---------------------------------------------

   `findPerson` resolves a person by id, then `full_name`, then `first + last`, then `handle`, then
   `username`, FIRST MATCH WINS. A handle that duplicates any of those makes `changePin` check the
   PIN somebody typed against ANOTHER PERSON'S ROW and tell them their own PIN is wrong — the denial
   CLAUDE.md already records, which happened by accident to one person. Letting people choose their
   own handle turns that accident into something a person can do on purpose, so the uniqueness cases
   below are the ones that matter most even though the word list is what anybody asks about first.

   IT CUTS THE TWO FUNCTIONS OUT OF `people.gs` AND RUNS THEM, which is `check-marking.js`'s method
   and is safe for the same reason: they touch nothing else. A second implementation here would be a
   second thing to keep in step — the fault this repository records under `childrenOf`, under
   `link`/`source_url` and under `factsNow_`.

   RUN IT:  node js/check-handles.js
