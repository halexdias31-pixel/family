# @family. — the map

A tutoring business's site. Static front end on GitHub Pages, Google Apps Script backend, three
spreadsheets as the database. No build step, no framework, no package.json for the site itself —
`index.html` lists the JavaScript files and the browser concatenates them into one global scope.

**Read this first, then the file you need.** It exists because the codebase is 64% prose: 1.4 MB of
source, 511 KB of actual code, and the rest is comments explaining decisions that were paid for in
bugs. That prose is the most valuable thing here and it is also why finding anything takes a while.

---

## The shape of it

```
index.html      lists the js/ files IN ORDER and starts the boot fetch while still parsing
style.css       448 KB, 1970 rules. --css-version at the top says which build is running
js/             40 files, ONE SHARED GLOBAL SCOPE. No imports. Order is load-bearing.
backend/        the Apps Script project. GitHub only holds a COPY — see "Deploying" below.
check/          the harness that replaces looking at it on a phone
```

### The one rule in `js/`

Every file shares one scope, so **a file must not be reordered against the others**. `index.html`
holds the list; the list is the order. Nothing fails at load if a name is missing — that is the cost
of plain scripts over modules, and it is paid by `js/check.js`, which reads every file and reports
any name used but never declared. Run it after every change.

### The spine

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `js/shell.js` | **The runtime.** `screen(id, draw)` registers a screen, `go(id)` switches to one, `placeCells()` positions the panes, `toast()` speaks. 25 KB of code under 97 KB of comments. |
| `js/data.js` | `API` (the Apps Script URL), `DATA`, `load()`'s state, the small helpers, `missingKeys()`. |
| `js/boot.js` | Last file loaded. Draws the first screen, then calls `load()`. Nothing may go below it. |
| `js/find.js` | The funnel — the app's main surface. Biggest file at 185 KB. |
| `js/book.js` | Sessions, seats, payment. |

Twelve screens are registered, in `TAB_ORDER` (js/shell.js): `feed`, `booking`, `shop` (things for
sale and the basket — Find no longer has a Shop door), `reel`, `dm`, `stuff` (the funnel — learning
only now — and the root), `account`, `tools`, `games`, `saved`, `spotlight`, `settings`.

### Layout, and why the checks are shaped the way they are

Screens sit **side by side** and slide — `placeCells()` positions them with transforms. So at any
moment most of the app is parked off-canvas left and right of the viewport. **That is the design,
not a bug.** Any check that asks "is this element past the right edge of the window" will report
about 156 false alarms. Ask "does this box scroll sideways when it was not told it could" instead.

---

## Where the data comes from

`DATA` is one JSON payload from one `doGet`. The sheet is the database; the site reads it and
almost never writes to it directly.

- **`brand` tab** — key/value. Read as `brand('key', fallback)`. Every call passes a fallback, so an
  empty tab still renders. **This is the pattern to copy for anything new.**
- **`config` tab** — key/value numbers and switches, reaching the site as `DATA.constants.vars`.
- **`facets` / `kinds` tabs** — what the funnel asks and what the answers are called. These moved out
  of `find.js` deliberately: editorial, changes often, changing it should not be a deploy.
- Everything else — people, venues, jobs, pricing, posts, links, laws, landmarks, holidays — is a
  tab, listed in `TAB` in `backend/constants.gs` with the column list in `SCHEMA` beside it and the
  file it lives in in `WHERE`. **All three have to name it.** `TAB` without `WHERE` is a tab nothing
  can open; `WHERE` without `SCHEMA` is a tab `ensureSchema` will never repair. `check-tabs.js` is
  the instrument, and it runs before `check-columns.js` because a tab nobody can open has no
  columns.

**A key the site asks for and the backend does not send fails silently.** `|| []` turns it into an
empty list, which looks exactly like an empty database.

`node js/check-payload.js` is the instrument for this. It reads the files, so it sees every read
whether or not anybody performed it — which is the difference between it and `missingKeys()`, the
console helper that only records keys something actually reached for, and so only knows about the
screens you happened to open, in the state you happened to be in, as the person you happened to be
signed in as. A key read only by an admin on the print queue is invisible to `missingKeys()` until
an admin opens the print queue.

It reports two directions and they are not the same severity. **Read and never sent** is a feature
that silently does nothing, and fails the build. **Sent and never read** is a tab walked and shipped
to every phone on every load for nobody — weight worth deleting, but it breaks nothing, so it
reports and does not fail. There are 23 of those right now.

Keys that are read, deliberately not sent, and known about live in `ACCEPTED` at the top of that
file, **one written reason each**. They are still printed. The point of the list is that a *new*
dead key fails loudly instead of joining a red that nobody reads.

---

## Deploying — they are not the same thing

| What changed | How it goes live |
|---|---|
| `index.html`, `js/`, `style.css` | `git push` → GitHub Pages. About a minute. |
| `backend/*.gs` | push to `main`, then run **`pullFromGitHub`** in the Apps Script editor. |
| Spreadsheet contents | Immediately — *if* the edit watch is installed. See below. |

### Two routes, and the one that is actually used pulls

There are two ways `backend/` reaches Apps Script and they run in opposite directions:

- **`pullFromGitHub` in `backend/sync.gs`** — run from the function dropdown in the Apps Script
  editor. It downloads `backend/` from `main` over `raw.githubusercontent.com` and writes it into
  the project through the Apps Script API. **This is the one in use.** No terminal, no token stored
  anywhere, nothing to configure beyond the API switch. `previewFromGitHub` does the same read and
  writes nothing — run it first, every time, because it is the only thing that shows a **deletion**
  before it happens.
- **`.github/workflows/apps-script.yml`** — `clasp push` on every push to `main`. Better in
  principle (nobody has to remember to run it) and unused in practice, because `clasp login` needs a
  terminal.

**The workflow failed nine times out of nine and every failure was the same line**: `SCRIPT_ID` and
`CLASP_CREDENTIALS` are not set. They are not set because that route was never taken. It now
**skips rather than fails** when the secrets are absent — a permanent red cross on every merge, for
a route nobody chose, is a red that teaches you to ignore red. A secret that is present and *wrong*
still fails loudly; absent and broken are different answers.

**Both routes replace the project's files wholesale**, so the warning below holds either way: what
is typed into the Apps Script editor and not committed here is gone at the next sync.

What `pullFromGitHub` needs:

| | Why |
|---|---|
| `script.projects` in `oauthScopes` | ✅ without it Google answers 403 and `apiTrouble_` says so |
| the repo **public** | ✅ the raw URLs are fetched unauthenticated |
| `backend/files.json` naming every file | ✅ it pulls by that list; `check-manifest.js` keeps it honest |
| the Apps Script API on **for the script's own Cloud project** | ❌ **and this is the one that blocks it** |

#### THERE ARE TWO APPS SCRIPT API SWITCHES AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ONE

This cost a run and it is not written down anywhere obvious:

- **The account-level toggle** at <https://script.google.com/home/usersettings>. This is what
  **clasp** needs, because clasp calls the API as its own Google OAuth client.
- **The Cloud-project-level enablement**, in the Cloud console, for the project the call is billed
  to. `sync.gs` calls the API with `ScriptApp.getOAuthToken()`, so the caller IS the script's own
  Cloud project and that project needs the API switched on. The 403 names it outright —
  `consumer: projects/850507942585`.

`apiTrouble_` already tells the two apart by whether Google's message carries a project number, and
it was right. **The account toggle being on does nothing for `pullFromGitHub`.**

**AND THAT PROJECT CANNOT BE OPENED.** `hermes` sits on an auto-created default Cloud project, and
the console answers `resourcemanager.projects.get (missing)` to its own owner. There is no
permission to grant yourself; a default project is not reachable that way. So `pullFromGitHub` is
blocked until the script is moved to a standard Cloud project, which means an OAuth consent screen
and a re-authorisation — and since the web app is `ANYONE_ANONYMOUS` running as `USER_DEPLOYING`,
that re-authorisation is what every anonymous visitor depends on. **Not a thing to do casually on a
live site**, which is why it is the third choice and not the first.

#### So: three routes, and the ranking changed

1. **The GitHub Assistant browser extension** — the `Repository ▾ / Branch ▾ / ↓ ↑` controls in the
   editor toolbar. It works through the editor's own session rather than the public API, so none of
   the above applies to it. Nothing to enable, nothing to authorise.
2. **clasp, via the workflow.** Needs a terminal exactly once for `clasp login`, and the
   account-level toggle it depends on **is already on** — so this is closer to working than the nine
   red runs suggest. The secrets were never the only blocker, and they were never the wrong one.
3. **`pullFromGitHub`.** The best-fitting route on paper and the one currently blocked. Leave it
   until moving the Cloud project is worth the re-auth risk.

`sync.js` in the repo root watches the folder and pushes on save. It now stages `backend/` too.


## Checking your work

`.claude/session-start.sh` runs the whole suite on arrival and prints `all N checks pass` or `CHECKS ARE RED ON ARRIVAL`. Run `node js/check.js` after every change and `npm run check` before pushing. A check that cannot reach its subject must exit non-zero, and a mutation is only proved when the real files are green again.

```bash
npm install                      # the hook does this for you on a fresh clone
                                 # acorn, jsdom and playwright — for the checks only.
npm run check                    # everything, via js/check-all.js
node js/check.js                 # names used but never declared. Two seconds. Run always.
node js/check-flow.js            # 21 journeys through the real app in jsdom
node js/check-payload.js         # every DATA key the site reads vs every key doGet sends
node js/check-booking.js         # the booking state machine, folded in Node
node js/check-backend.js         # one Apps Script scope: every name declared exactly once
node js/check-tabs.js            # every tab routed to one of the three files, and the ids look sane
node js/check-rows.js            # each column read, against the tab that row actually came from
node js/check-post.js            # an action that names a person by a cell they can edit
node js/check-library.js         # data/questions.json: ids, 80 marks, the closed facet vocabulary
node js/check-marking.js         # a right answer marked right, a wrong one wrong
node js/check-practicals.js      # the 41 practicals, and whether their topics join to anything
node js/check-funnel.js          # the real funnel over the real library: can each question narrow?
node js/check-const.js           # nothing declared `const` is assigned to. Two seconds.
node check/deploy.js             # after a push, does a browser that has the site run the new code
node check/ui.js                 # 9 screens x 4 widths x 2 visitors. Exits 1 on anything new.
node check/ui.js --screen=tools  # one screen
node check/ui.js --shots         # also writes PNGs to check/shots/ for a human to look at
node check/live.js --sheets s.json --out /tmp/p.json   # the REAL doGet over the REAL spreadsheets
node check/ui.js --payload=/tmp/p.json                 # and the real app rendered against it
```

## House style

Follow it. It is unusual and it is deliberate.

- **Comments say WHY, and what went wrong before.** Not what the line does. Most of them are a bug
  report written from the far side. Match the density of the file you are in.
- **Fallbacks everywhere.** `brand(k, or)`, `|| []`, `try/catch` around anything that can be absent.
  An empty or broken sheet must still produce a working site.
- Plain scripts, no modules, no framework, no build.
- **A THING has tiles; a FORM has buttons.** This is the rule that decides which of the app's two
  action surfaces to use, and it was never written down — which is the only reason the app looked
  inconsistent. Measured: 46 inline `<button>`s against 21 `tile_()` calls, so tiles are the
  *minority*, and the split is by context rather than by accident.
  - **Tiles** (`tiles.js`, one renderer) are the action row under a **thing**: a paper, a tutor, a
    shop item, a session. One `tile_({icon, label, note, act, data})` per action, wrapped in a
    `.tile-row`. Tap targets, icons and the press animation come from one place, and `check-doors`
    pairs every `act` against a handler.
  - **Buttons** are the controls inside a **form or a dialog** — the booking form, the pay sheet,
    the composer. A form's buttons belong to the form.
  - **Tiles win any tie.** One renderer means one place to fix a tap target; 46 inline buttons is 46
    places to get it wrong. If you are unsure which you are building, it is a thing, and it is tiles.
  - A tile has room for a label and about three words of `note`. When an action needs a real warning
    — "everyone is withdrawn", "never as though Stripe had confirmed it" — put **one** paragraph
    under the row rather than one per button. See `jobAdminTiles_`.
- **THERE ARE TWO PALETTES.** The screen is black and gold (`--bg`, `--gold`, `--ink`, `--line`).
  Everything standing in for PAPER — the receipt, the job stubs, the roster, the print sheet, the
  calendar, the splash — is cream and warm ink (`--paper`, `--paper-ink`, `--paper-dim`,
  `--paper-faint`, `--paper-strip`, `--paper-rule`). Only the first was ever tokenised: the paper
  one was six hex codes written out by hand, `#f4f1e8` alone in 29 rule-groups, so "make the paper
  warmer" was a find-and-replace across ~70 declarations and one missed leaves a card with two
  different papers in it. **Never write a paper colour as a literal.**
- **Which palette a colour belongs to decides its scope.** A colour used by more than one component
  is a `:root` token. A colour that belongs to ONE component — a chess board's cream and charcoal,
  which is that board's own convention and not this app's — is defined on that component
  (`.chess { --chess-light: … }`) so it is named without being offered to the whole stylesheet.
- **Tap targets in `px`, everything else in `rem`.** Line 121 sets the root to
  `clamp(13.5px, 3.8vw, 16px)`, so a rem is 14.82px on a 390px phone. `2.75rem` for a 44px target
  comes out at 40.75px and still fails. A fingertip is the same size on every screen; it is the one
  measurement here that must not scale.
- Version constants — `BACKEND_VERSION`, `DOGET_VERSION`, `DOPOST_VERSION`, `BOOKING_VERSION` — are
  compared on the **whole stamp**, so bump all four together or the You screen reports the untouched
  ones as "Not deployed".


## History

The full record of past bugs and decisions (about 1.2 MB) lives in `docs/history/`, one file per topic, listed in `docs/history/README.md`. It is NOT loaded automatically. Before changing an area, `grep -ril <keyword> docs/history` and read the matching file: those notes record why the code is shaped the way it is and what was tried and reverted.

Recurring lessons, in one line each: fix the rule, not the instance; a fixture must send what `doGet` really sends; a screenshot is the last word on anything drawn; print a count rather than a silence; a mutation proves a check only when the real files go green again.
