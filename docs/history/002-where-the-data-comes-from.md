## Where the data comes from

`DATA` is one JSON payload from one `doGet`. The sheet is the database; the site reads it and
almost never writes to it directly.

- **`brand` tab** — key/value. Read as `brand('key', fallback)`. Every call passes a fallback, so an
  empty tab still renders. **This is the pattern to copy for anything new.**
- **`config` tab** — key/value numbers and switches, reaching the site as `DATA.constants.vars`.
- **`facets` / `kinds` tabs** — what the funnel asks and what the answers are called. These moved out
  of `find.js` deliberately: editorial, changes often, changing it should not be a deploy.
- Everything else — people, venues, jobs, pricing, posts, links, laws, landmarks, holidays — is a
  tab, listed in `TAB` in `backend/constants.gs` with the column list in `SCHEMA` beside it and the
  file it lives in in `WHERE`. **All three have to name it.** `TAB` without `WHERE` is a tab nothing
  can open; `WHERE` without `SCHEMA` is a tab `ensureSchema` will never repair. `check-tabs.js` is
  the instrument, and it runs before `check-columns.js` because a tab nobody can open has no
  columns.

**A key the site asks for and the backend does not send fails silently.** `|| []` turns it into an
empty list, which looks exactly like an empty database.

`node js/check-payload.js` is the instrument for this. It reads the files, so it sees every read
whether or not anybody performed it — which is the difference between it and `missingKeys()`, the
console helper that only records keys something actually reached for, and so only knows about the
screens you happened to open, in the state you happened to be in, as the person you happened to be
signed in as. A key read only by an admin on the print queue is invisible to `missingKeys()` until
an admin opens the print queue.

It reports two directions and they are not the same severity. **Read and never sent** is a feature
that silently does nothing, and fails the build. **Sent and never read** is a tab walked and shipped
to every phone on every load for nobody — weight worth deleting, but it breaks nothing, so it
reports and does not fail. There are 23 of those right now.

Keys that are read, deliberately not sent, and known about live in `ACCEPTED` at the top of that
file, **one written reason each**. They are still printed. The point of the list is that a *new*
dead key fails loudly instead of joining a red that nobody reads.
