   @family. — check/states.js

   THE STATES A SCREEN CAN BE IN, DECLARED ONCE AND READ BY BOTH INSTRUMENTS.

   `check/ui.js` MEASURES whether a screen can be read and hit; `check/press.js` PRESSES it and asks
   whether anything happened. They are two questions about the same nine screens, and both of them
   were blind in the same way before states existed: a screen has more than one, and `go(id)` only
   ever shows the one it opens in.

   THIS LIVES IN ITS OWN FILE BECAUSE A SECOND COPY WOULD DRIFT. That is the sentence this
   repository has already written about `documents_()`, about `paperIdOf_`, about `factsNow_` and
   about `childrenOf` — two readers of one fact are two chances to disagree about it, and here the
   disagreement would be silent in the worst direction: a state added for the measuring pass and not
   the pressing one is a surface nobody presses, which is exactly the hole the booking grid lived in.

   EVERY FUNCTION HERE RUNS IN THE BROWSER, not in node. They are passed across as source
   (`String(state.enter)`) and evaluated in the page, so they may use the app's own globals — `go`,
   `paint`, `openSheet`, `STUFF`, `MESSAGES` — and may not use anything from this file.
================================================================================================== */

/* ==================================================================================================
   A SCREEN IS NOT ONE PICTURE, AND THIS FILE HAD ONLY EVER TAKEN ONE OF EACH.

   `go(id)` PUTS A SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU IN THE STATE IT OPENS IN, and for the Find screen that
   state is the funnel's question — a search box, some chips and a short list of answers. The
   RESULTS are pages you swipe to, and they are where every question card in the library is drawn.
   So this check has measured 72 combinations, on every run, for as long as it has existed, and
   NEVER ONCE RENDERED A QUESTION. The app's largest surface, four thousand rows of it.

   IT COST EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT. Fifty-one questions carry the printed paper's dotted
   answer line, the longest 128 characters with no space in it — one unbreakable word that took the
   card, the pane and the page sideways at every width. `check/ui.js` measures sideways scroll and
   would have named it on the first run. Nothing did, because nothing ever turned the page.

   THIS IS THE `check-flow` STUB AGAIN, AND THE `check-booking` PATH BEFORE IT: a check that cannot
   reach its subject reporting a pass. The count in the summary said 72 combinations and meant it;
   what it did not say is that 72 combinations is nine screens seen once each.

   SO A SCREEN DECLARES ITS STATES. A state is a name and a line of the app's own code — no new
   navigation, no reaching past `go()`, just the same calls a finger would make. Anything not listed
   here is measured exactly as it was before, in the one state it opens in.

   AND A STATE THAT DOES NOT ARRIVE FAILS LOUDLY, for the same reason the signed-in seed does: a
   search that finds nothing would render an empty results page and report it as a clean sweep of
   the library. It asserts what it expects to be looking at. */

       for every one of them the Find screen read "Nothing in the shop or the library yet." — this
       repository's oldest fault, on its main screen, on every first visit.

       `LIBRARY_ROWS` IS THE STATE AND IT IS THE APP'S OWN. `null` until the file lands, `[]` when
       it legitimately holds nothing — so this seeds through the same door the boot uses rather
       than inventing a flag, which is what every other state here does. The memo has to go with
       it, or `stuffItems` hands back the list it built when the library WAS there.

       `only:` FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THIS FILE, and for a stronger reason than the flyer widget's.
       That one is a roster gate on the phone; this is the PAYLOAD — `doGet` builds `films` inside
       `if (viewerIsAdmin)` and sends `[]` to everybody else, so a signed-out visitor has no rows,
       no funnel answer and nothing to measure. Asking them to reach it would report a fault about
       the check rather than about the app, which is what `only` is for.

       THE FIXTURE'S THREE ROWS ARE INVENTED. That file is committed to a public repository and
       holds nothing real — see the note on them. What they are for is the SHAPE: a very long
       title against the flag, a series with no year, and a placeholder with no link, which are the
       three ways this card can be drawn. */

  /* ---------- THE TWO WIDGETS THAT ARE TALLER THAN A SCREEN ------------------------------------
     `--screen=tools` MEASURED PAGE ONE AND NOTHING ELSE. The Tools column is one widget per page,
     so nine widgets were being reported on as one — and the two that did not fit were both further
     down. Reported by the owner as "I can't scroll down on some"; measured at 390px, the cheat
     sheet maker's card was 1263px inside an 805px pane and the flyer's 1252px, so 458px and 447px
     were clipped, taking the A4 preview and the Print button with them.

     THIS IS THE `check/cards.js` LESSON, one column along: the summary said eight combinations and
     meant it, and what it did not say is that eight combinations is one page seen eight times. The
     fix is not a new rule — `ui.js` already measures sideways scroll, tap targets and contrast, and
     would have measured these — it is a STATE, which is the sentence CLAUDE.md already carries
     about the funnel's answer rows.

     BY NAME, NOT BY PAGE NUMBER. `widgetColumn_` builds from the roster, so a widget added or
     switched off moves every index after it — and a state that silently lands on the wrong widget
     is worse than one that fails, because it reports a pass about something it did not look at.
     `expect` is what makes that loud. */
  /* ---------- THE SAVED COLUMN, IN BOTH OF ITS STATES --------------------------------------------
     IT IS EMPTY FOR EVERY VISITOR ON A FRESH BROWSER, which is the state `check/press.js` and
     `check/ui.js` would both have measured and the only one they could reach — the same hole the
     booking receipt and the message thread were in, and the one the removed Carry-on block was in
     when a whole feature went unpressed. A column whose contents come from `localStorage` needs a
     state that seeds it or the lab reports a clean sweep of a card it never saw.

     SEEDED THROUGH `toggleFav`, THE APP'S OWN WRITER, rather than by writing the key out here: the
     prefix is `WIDGET_KEY`'s and a second spelling of it would be a second thing to keep in step.
     `leave` takes them back off, because states run in order down one page. */
  /* ---------- AN UNLISTED TUTOR, WHICH ONLY AN ADMIN IS SENT --------------------------------------
     REPORTED AS "where did george dissapear off to?" — and this column had been filtering unlisted
     tutors back out on the phone after `doGet` had deliberately sent them to an admin, so that
     `findCard`'s dimmed `· not listed` row and `asItem_`'s `off` flag were both unreachable code.

     NO FIXTURE CAN HOLD THIS ONE. `check/fixture.json` has a single tutor and she is listed, so the
     only account column the lab has ever measured is the one where every row is live — which is the
     hole the booking receipt, the message thread and the basket were each in. Seeded onto
     `DATA.tutors`, which is where `accountPages_` reads from and what `load()` fills.

     `only:` BECAUSE A NON-ADMIN IS NEVER SENT ONE. `doget.gs` gates it on `viewerIsAdmin`, so
     asking a stranger to reach this state would report a fault about the check rather than the app
     — the same argument as the films two blocks up. */

     auto` label, and where the mark for your own line has to survive the flappy card's own row
     colours.

     SEEDED THROUGH THE PAYLOAD, which is the same door `load()` uses — `scoreRanks_` reads
     `DATA.students` and `DATA.tutors` and nothing else, so putting rows there is the app arriving
     at this state rather than the harness reaching past it.

     AND THE SEEDED TUTOR IS DELIBERATELY EIGHTH. If the visitor were in the top five the board

  /* ---------- AND A SESSION RECEIPT, WHICH THIS FILE HAS NEVER HAD ON THE SCREEN ----------------
     MEASURED, SIGNED IN, AGAINST THE REAL FIXTURE: the booking column draws ONE page and it is the
     form. `myJobs_()` keeps the sessions whose `client` or `tutor` is the visitor, and the
     fixture's one job names neither — so `bookBlocks` returns the form and nothing else, and
     `booking: nothing to report` has meant that single page at four widths on every run.

     THE RECEIPT IS THE MOST-COMPLAINED-ABOUT CARD IN THE APP and it was outside the measurement
     the whole time. That is the `dm` note one column along, and the booking-screen-signed-out note
     before it, for a third time — and it is what let `Per session` wrap its label on every receipt
     ever drawn while a hundred and four combinations came back clean.

     SEEDED THROUGH THE PAYLOAD, NOT THE MARKUP. `DATA.liveJobs` is what `myJobs_` reads, so a job
     naming the signed-in visitor as its client is the state the app is in a moment after `load()`
     — the app's own door, the same move the seeded thread and the seeded visitor both make.

     ONE SESSION WITH EVERY ROW FILLED IN, because the fault this state exists to catch is a label
     or a value that does not fit its column, and a row with nothing in it cannot show one. Six
     dates so the `Dates` row has a range and a count; a price so the total row draws; a venue name
     as long as a real one. */
  /* ---------- THE CAMERA WITH A PICTURE ON IT ----------------------------------------------------
     THE `make` COLUMN OPENS ON A VIEWFINDER AND NOTHING ELSE. `Again`, `Post it`, `Save a copy`,
     the caption box and the row that says who it goes up as are all `hidden` until there is a
     photograph — so HALF THE CAMERA has been outside this lab for as long as it has existed, and
     `check/press.js` reported `cam-post`, `cam-save` and `cam-again` as untouched rather than as
     faults, because an action on no screen is one it cannot reach.

     WHAT THAT COST, MEASURED THE DAY THIS WAS WRITTEN: with a picture on the card the column ran
     55px BELOW THE SCREEN at 390 and 36px past the pane's own fold at 768. Neither is visible to
     the two rules that were watching — the pane's `scrollHeight` equals its `clientHeight`, so
     nothing is overflowing; it is the PANE that hangs off the bottom, because `columnShift_`
     centres the page it was placed with and nothing re-placed it when the card grew.

     THROUGH THE APP'S OWN PICKER, not by drawing on the canvas. `on('cam-pick')` reads
     `el.files[0]`, so a `DataTransfer` carrying a real one-pixel PNG is the same event a finger
     makes — which matters here more than usual, because the thing being measured is what that
     handler reveals. A container has no camera, so `cam-shoot` is not a door this can use.

     AND IT IS PUT BACK. States run in order down one page and `camAgain_` is the app's own way to
     throw a picture away, so the next state and the next screen are not measured with a photograph
     still on the card — the same reason the guide state closes its sheet. */

    /* ---------- THE WAITING-LIST BRANCH, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT FORM ----------------------------
       `isWaiting_()` CHANGES SIX ROWS AND THE WHOLE WEEK. An ordinary booking ticks eleven hours a
       day and a waiting list ticks three blocks — different grid, different cell count, different
       height — and until this state existed the lab had only ever seen the first. That is the same
       hole the session receipt and the message thread were each in: a branch the fixture cannot
       reach, measured by nothing, on the app's most control-dense card.

       IT COST THE CARD'S LAST THREE PIXELS TO FIND OUT. Measured on its first run: 803px of card in
       an 807px pane, `under: 3`. There is no headroom on this branch at all, which is why the block
       grid's cells are 20px rather than 44 and why the row above it spans — both written up where
       they are.

       SEEDED THROUGH `BOOKING.how` AND `drawBooker()`, which is exactly what the Kind dropdown's
       own `change` handler does. `isWaiting_` tests for "wait", so the string is the option's own
       words rather than a shape that happens to match.

       AND TWO BLOCKS ARE TICKED, because one is not a summary. `blockSay_` groups by block and
       collapses runs of days, and a single cell exercises none of that — `Mon · Tue evenings` is
       the shortest answer that proves the row is a sentence rather than a list of phrases. */

           right at the top of the waiting block. So every run of this state has measured the card
           WITHOUT `A seat`, `Shared by`, `Per session`, `Term` or `About` on it: five of the rows
           that only exist on this branch, on the state written to measure this branch.

           IT NEEDED A SEAT PRICE IN THE FIXTURE TOO. `DATA.waitlistSeat` is a venue-keyed map the
           backend computes, and the fixture had no such key — so the lab could not have drawn this

           nothing about when is a state one tick away from being replaced by the harness's own
           empty fixture. `DM_LAST` is when the column last asked, and this state IS an answer

           being declared. */

    /* ---------- AND AN INBOX, WHICH IS THE STATE THE FAULT WAS IN ---------------------------------
       ONE CONVERSATION IS NOT AN INBOX. The state above seeds a single thread — deliberately, for
       what it measures: which side a bubble sits on and how a run of three collapses. It fits on one
       pane, so for as long as it was the only seeded state this column could not have shown the
       fault it actually had: `screen('dm')` stacked EVERY conversation into one `.pane`, which is
       `overflow: hidden`, and at 390×844 with six of them 493px of somebody's messages were on the
       page with no scroll and no page to turn to.

       I WROTE THE RULE FIRST AND IT REPORTED NOTHING, which is the only reason this state exists:
       putting the `stack()` back did not fire it either, because two cards fit. A rule that cannot
       fail is not a rule — this file has deleted one for exactly that — and what was missing was
       never the rule, it was the state. Same sentence as the filter chips six answers deep.

       SIX, BECAUSE FIVE FITS. Measured at the tallest of the four widths: five conversations sit
       inside the pane and the sixth is what pushes it over, so this is the smallest inbox that can
       answer the question at every width rather than at 320 alone. */
